**R**adiomic **E**xtraction and **A**nalysis for **DI**COM **I**mages

A package to extract radiomic features from DICOM CT images.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install readii
```

### (recommended) Create new `pixi` environment for a project
```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
pixi init
pixi add --pypi readii
```

### (recommended) Create new conda virtual environment
```
conda create -n readii python=3.9
conda activate readii
pip install readii
```

## Usage
`readii` is a tool to perform radiomic feature extraction on DICOM CT images with region of interest (ROI) segmentations as either DICOM SEG or RTSTRUCT.

```bash
$ readii [INPUT DIRECTORY] [OUTPUT DIRECTORY] \
  --roi_names [str] \
  --pyradiomics_setting [str] \
  --negative_controls [str: shuffled_full,shuffled_roi,shuffled_non_roi,randomized_full,randomized_roi,randomized_non_roi,randomized_sampled_full,randomized_sampled_roi, randomized_sampled_non_roi] \
  --parallel [flag]
  --update [flag]
```

### Negative control options

Negative controls are applied to one of three masks: 
1. full = voxels in the entire image
2. roi = just voxels within the specified region of interest (ROI) in the segmentation
3. non_roi = all voxels except the ROI.

The three transformations are:
1. shuffle = shuffle all voxels in the specified mask
2. randomized = randomly generate new values within the original range within the specified mask
3. randomized_sampled = randomly sample original values with replacement to get new values within the specified mask


## Contributing

Please use the following angular commit message format:
```
<type>(optional scope): short summary in present tense

(optional body: explains motivation for the change)

(optional footer: note BREAKING CHANGES here, and issues to be closed)

```
`<type>` refers to the kind of change made and is usually one of:

- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation changes.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
- `test`: Changes to the test framework.
- `build`: Changes to the build process or tools.

`scope` is an optional keyword that provides context for where the change was made. It can be anything relevant to your package or development workflow (e.g., it could be the module or function - name affected by the change).
